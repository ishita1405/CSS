CSS Interview Theory Notes
1️⃣ Why do we remove default margin and padding?

Browsers apply default margin and padding to some HTML elements such as body, headings, and paragraphs. This may create unwanted spacing in the layout.

To maintain consistency and full control over design, developers reset margin and padding to zero using a universal selector. This practice ensures predictable and clean layouts across different browsers.

2️⃣ What is the CSS Box Model?

The CSS Box Model describes how elements are structured and spaced on a webpage. Every element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of:

Content – The actual text or image.

Padding – Space between content and border.

Border – The outline around padding.

Margin – Space outside the border.

The total size of an element depends on width, padding, and border.

3️⃣ What is the purpose of box-sizing?

The box-sizing property controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

By default, box-sizing is set to content-box, where padding and border are added outside the defined width and height.

When set to border-box, padding and border are included inside the defined width and height.

Using border-box makes layout management easier and more predictable, especially in responsive design.

4️⃣ What is CSS Specificity?

CSS Specificity determines which style rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.

The priority order from highest to lowest is:

Inline styles > ID selectors > Class selectors > Element selectors > Universal selector.

Higher specificity rules override lower ones.

5️⃣ What is the difference between Class and ID?

A class selector is used to style multiple elements and can be reused across a webpage.

An ID selector is used to style one unique element and should not be repeated.

ID selectors have higher specificity than class selectors.

6️⃣ What are the ways to apply CSS?

There are three ways to apply CSS:

Inline CSS – Applied directly inside an HTML element using the style attribute.

Internal CSS – Written inside a <style> tag within the HTML file.

External CSS – Written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document.

External CSS is the most recommended method for large and professional projects.

7️⃣ What is Margin in CSS?

Margin is the space outside an element’s border. It controls the distance between elements.

Margins can be applied to all four sides individually or using shorthand notation.

Vertical margins between two elements may collapse, meaning the larger margin value is applied instead of adding both.

8️⃣ What is the Display Property?

The display property defines how an element behaves in the layout.

Common values include:

Block – Takes full width and starts on a new line.

Inline – Takes only required width and does not start on a new line.

Inline-block – Behaves like inline but allows width and height control.

None – Removes the element from the document flow.

Flex – Enables flexible layout system.

Grid – Enables two-dimensional layout system.

9️⃣ What is the order Property?

The order property is used in flexbox and grid layouts to control the visual order of elements.

The default value is 0. Lower values appear first.

It changes only the visual order, not the actual HTML structure.


CSS Box Model

Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box consisting of:

Content → Padding → Border → Margin

Content is the actual text or image.
Padding is the inner space between content and border.
Border surrounds padding.
Margin is the outer space between elements.

Margin in CSS

Margin creates space outside the border of an element.

Margins can be applied to:

top

right

bottom

left

Vertical margins may collapse, meaning the larger margin value is applied instead of adding both

Padding

Padding creates space inside the element between content and border.
It increases the element’s visible size unless box-sizing: border-box is used.

Display Property

The display property controls how an element behaves in layout.

block → takes full width and starts on new line
inline → takes only required width, no new line
inline-block → inline but width & height allowed
none → element removed from layout

Visibility Property

visibility: hidden hides the element but space remains reserved.
display: none removes the element completely from layout.

Border Styles

Common border styles:

solid, dashed, dotted, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset, none

Flex-wrap

flex-wrap: wrap allows flex items to move to the next line when space is not available.

Without wrap, items shrink to fit in one row.

Order Property (Flexbox)

The order property changes the visual order of flex items.

Default value = 0
Lower value appears first.
It only changes visual position, not HTML structure.
